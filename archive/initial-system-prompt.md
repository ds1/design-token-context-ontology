I’m building a comprehensive context ontology for design tokens. The attached document represents my current working draft, covering 18 context dimensions, a volatility hierarchy, context types, and inheritance rules.

I want to stress-test this model systematically. Let’s start by examining the **context dimensions** for completeness.

For each of the 8 dimension categories (Platform & Runtime, Input & Interaction, Viewport & Layout, Information Density, Theme & Appearance, Accessibility, Temporal & State, Environmental, Localization), I need you to:

1. **Validate existing dimensions**: Are the values comprehensive? Are there missing values?
1. **Identify missing dimensions**: What contexts within this category aren’t captured?
1. **Surface dependencies**: Which dimensions in this category have hidden relationships with dimensions in other categories?
1. **Find the edge cases**: What real-world scenarios would break or confuse this dimension’s resolution?

Start with **Platform & Runtime**. Be exhaustive—I’d rather over-enumerate and prune than miss something critical.
